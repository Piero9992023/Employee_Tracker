  ## Description
  The motivation to create this project was to showcase my newly learned skills of mysql. I was really looking forward to create this project since mysql is one of my favorite database management systems that I have learned so far. I built this project so that a business owner can be able to use this application to manage their business roles and employees with efficiency. The problem that my application solves is the stress that business owners face when they don't have an organized database management system where they can manage and control their business. I have learned many new things throughout the creation of this terminal application. For starters I have learned mnay new mysql queries that have helped me build this application. Also I have learned how to use the console.table package. I have also learned the importance to using prior experience/activites to create new applications moving forward in this bootcamp. 
  ## Installation
  The first step was to install the npm packages which include adding the inquirer packages to the file. The next step I took was to use the require method to use inquirer. Then I started to create the questions/prompt for the user/employee. Other packages that I have used in this project was express, mysql2, and console.table. The first thing a user has to do use my terminal application is to "npm i" to install all the npm packages they will need to start my application. Next the user will have to source all the sql databases through mysql; they can do this by entering mysql using "mysql -u root -p" in their local machine and once they enter mysql then they can source the schema.sql and seeds.sql files, then they can exit mysql. The next step would be to run the server by inputing the command "node server,js" in the terminal.
